For feature requests or bugs, please open an [Issue](https://github.com/digihunch/orthweb/issues).

Orthweb focuses on a streamlined deployment experience for demo. The idealism of 1-click deployment often conflicts with the reality of the diverse requirement between clients. Therefore it is necessary to leave some area of design and implementation open for further customization. Please discuss with [Digi Hunch](https://www.digihunch.com/)üí° about further support and professional services. Some service areas include:

* Custom Orthanc Configurations
* Custom Networking infrastructure
* Deployment of Orthanc in custom [cloud platform](https://www.digihunch.com/cloud-platform/)
* Integration with existing services, such as security and IAM
* Design and build of custom [cloud landing zone](https://www.digihunch.com/2023/09/orchestrate-landing-zone-with-landing-zone-accelerator-on-aws/)
* Improvement of [Terraform workflow](https://medium.com/itnext/pains-in-terraform-collaboration-249a56b4534e)

Thank you for testing with Orthweb.  ‚ù§Ô∏è
