For feature requests or bugs, please open an [Issue](https://github.com/digihunch/orthweb/issues) on GitHub.

Orthweb proposes a streamlined deployment experience. The idealistic intent of 1-click setup process conflicts with the reality of having to support diverse range of requirements across clients. As a result, we have to strke a balance, by leaving some design areas and implementation work open with further customization. Please discuss with [Digi Hunch](https://www.digihunch.com/)üí° about support and professional services. Some service areas include:

* Custom Orthanc Configurations
* Custom Networking infrastructure
* Deployment of Orthanc in custom [cloud platform](https://www.digihunch.com/cloud-platform/)
* Integration with existing services, such as security and IAM
* Design and build of custom [cloud landing zone](https://www.digihunch.com/2023/09/orchestrate-landing-zone-with-landing-zone-accelerator-on-aws/)
* Improvement of [Terraform workflow](https://medium.com/itnext/pains-in-terraform-collaboration-249a56b4534e)
