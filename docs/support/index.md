For feature requests or bugs, please open an [Issue](https://github.com/digihunch/orthweb/issues).

Orthweb focuses on a streamlined deployment experience for demo purpose. However, Orthanc adopters often need their own customizations. Please discuss with [Digi Hunch](https://www.digihunch.com/)ðŸ’¡ about further support and professional services. Some areas may include:

* Customized Orthanc Configurations
* Customized networking infrastructure
* Deployment of Orthanc in customized [cloud platform](https://www.digihunch.com/cloud-platform/)
* Integration with existing services, environments or platforms
* Design and build of [cloud landing zone](https://www.digihunch.com/2023/09/orchestrate-landing-zone-with-landing-zone-accelerator-on-aws/)
* Improving your [Terraform workflow](https://medium.com/itnext/pains-in-terraform-collaboration-249a56b4534e)

Thank you for testing with Orthweb.
